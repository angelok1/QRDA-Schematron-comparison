# Summary

The schematron comparison script loads, parses, santizes, and compares 2 schematron files. The comparison is done by truncating the conformance ID, then using that to join the 2 result sets.

The script is a python script running in a Jupyter Python Notebook. That allows for a quick and easy method for writing and annotating the script in line. Additionally, the notebook stores the results in line as well, so the code doesn't need to be executed to get the results again. Many services natively understand the notebook (for example, github can render it).

## Prerequisites

Python 3.5 and Jupyter Notebook installation instructions can be found [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

## Starting the notebook

Once the prerequisites are installed, you can start the notebook for your specific environment by following the instructions [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html#running). 

Next, navigate to the "QRDA Schematron to Spreadsheet.ipynb" file in the browser that popped up.
